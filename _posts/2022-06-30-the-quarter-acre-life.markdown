I know, I haven't posted anything here for ages. I haven't been lazy. I've been quite the opposite in fact. Very busy!

## New YouTube Channel: The Quarter Acre Life

Yes, I decided to start a YouTube channel. Why? Because I figured I was going to be doing a lot of stuff in the garden anyway, so why not film what I'm doing and put it on YouTube?

I hope to keep this blog slightly more up-to-date now, but it may be linking more to video content from this point forward, rather than long-form blog posts.

Anyway, this is the intro video to the channel, which gives a tour of the quarter acre property, highlighting the various edible varieties of plants we're growing.
