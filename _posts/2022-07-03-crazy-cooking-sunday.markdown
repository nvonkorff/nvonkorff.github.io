Last Sunday was pretty crazy. So much cooking. Basically the whole day spent in and around the kitchen, but it was worth it.

## Pancakes for breakfast

Not the healthiest breakfast around, but it's nice to occasionally have a breakfast like this. I didn't make a video about this one. Maybe another time, when I have something from the garden (like blueberries) to have with the pancakes.
