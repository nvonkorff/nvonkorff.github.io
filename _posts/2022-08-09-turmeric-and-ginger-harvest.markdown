It's turmeric and ginger harvesting time. The plants have all started to die back and the rhizomes are ready for harvest.

## Part 1 - Back garden bed

This video shows me digging out and harvesting the two main turmeric plants I have in the back garden... and the ginger. A little disappointing on the ginger front. No matter, it at least provided four good pieces with roots to plant again (which was a tad rushed due to the rain). Hopefully the harvest of ginger will be better next season.

The turmeric did very well though. I got ~700g of usable turmeric from those two plants (and a lot of pieces to re-plant), and I still have yet to harvest the ones in the front yard. That is coming up in Part 2 of this video.

## Part 2 - Front garden bed

This video shows me digging out and harvesting the turmeric and ginger plants I have in a bed in the front garden.

I expected that the ginger didn't do that well, as the plants were only put in last season from small cuttings. The plants themselves didn't grow very big and had already died off completely. I actually got a few useable chunks of ginger, which is more than I was expecting.

The turmeric plants all looked very healthy and I must admit, I did expect more from them, considering how much I got from the two plants in the back garden. I ended up with about the same (~700g) from the back and front garden, but from 5-6 plants in the front, I did expect a bit more.

I'm hoping that the application of organic fertiliser will help with a more impressive harvest next season. I'll also need to remember to fertilise a bit more regularly, which is something I probably didn't do as much as I should have last season.

It was also a good excuse to get that bed cleared of weeds and mulched again.
